                    <p>
                        It was towards the end of 2024 when I decided that I needed yet another side project,
                        specifically one I could finish over the course of a weekend. At that point in time,
                        I was obsessed with language development and figured that a custom object notation and
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization">de/serialization</a> engine would fit the scope.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you're wondering about those funny words, de/serialization is the process of converting
                        data inside a program into a (usually) language-independent format like text (for example
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a>)
                        and vice versa. An object notation is simply that very same language-independent format, the specific structure the text needs
                        to take on (perhaps just another word for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)">syntax</a>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I always had this idea of an object notation with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking">static typing</a>,
                        still no clue how this is supposed to be useful for anything that proper object notations didn't solve already, but I just gave it a shot. 
                        Additionally, I also wanted to experiment with a modular approach to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis">tokenization</a>
                        and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing">parsing</a>, this project was naturally a good fit and acted as a 2-in-1 learning experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So I grabbed one of my favorite languages (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C#</a>), spent my mental capacities on finding a really
                        terrible name for my idea and ended up creating STONE. If it's not clear by the title of this post,
                        the name is an abbreviation for <b>S</b>tatically <b>T</b>yped <b>O</b>bject <b>N</b>otation <b>E</b>xperiment (I won't type that out another time, promised).

                    <h3>Implementation & Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        You might be thinking <i>Hey, shouldn't the order be Design & Implementation?</i> and that would be a fair assumption,
                        but due to one of the goals being a highly modular approach to tokenization and parsing this became the first thing I tackled.
                        Actually, one could say that this object notation doesn't even have a fixed design or specification or anything like this, it's all implementation defined.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The engine is driven by two interfaces called Token Rule and Type Provider. By contributing their own pieces of functionality and being able to
                        recursively call back into the engine, they handle most of the processing involved in serializing data and deserializing its STONE representation. 
                        Without any of those interfaces being registered in the appropriate locations, the engine is merely a fancy mechanism to throw exceptions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What I'm referring to is that the engine itself, especially for serialization, does nothing besides delegating the work into Type Providers. 
                        For deserialization, there's additional work that utilizes the Token Rules to transform the text into a more structured representation before, 
                        again, delegating the work into Type Providers. The only real functionalities provided by the engine are what I called a Source Walker and a Token Walker,
                        fancy names for something that's essentially iterating over a collection, tracking the current position inside of it and potentially allows for backtracking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'll show you the few important methods used for serialization, it's pretty simple:
                    </p>
                    <code>
<pre>
public static string Serialize(object data, Type type)
{
    // ... some safety checks ...

    StoneTree tree = CreateTreeFromData(data, type);
    string source = CreateSourceFromTree(tree, type);

    return source;
}


private static StoneTree CreateTreeFromData(object data, Type type)
{
    StoneEngineContext context = new StoneEngineContext
    {
        SourceFormatting = new StoneSourceFormattingContext(),
        CustomContexts = new Dictionary<Type, IStoneCustomContext>(),
    };

    for (int i = 0; i < m_TypeProviders.Count; i++)
    {
        if (m_TypeProviders[i].CanProvideType(context, type))
        {
            IStoneTreeNode rootNode = m_TypeProviders[i].CreateNodeFromData(context, data, type);
            return new StoneTree { Root = rootNode };
        }
    }

    throw new StoneEngineException($"No TypeProvider for {type}");
}


private static string CreateSourceFromTree(StoneTree tree, Type type)
{
    StoneEngineContext context = new StoneEngineContext
    {
        SourceFormatting = new StoneSourceFormattingContext(),
        CustomContexts = new Dictionary<Type, IStoneCustomContext>(),
    };

    for (int i = 0; i < m_TypeProviders.Count; i++)
    {
        if (m_TypeProviders[i].CanProvideType(context, type))
        {
            return m_TypeProviders[i].CreateSource(context, tree.Root, type);
        }
    }

    throw new StoneEngineException($"No TypeProvider for {type}");
}
</pre>
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        There's also a version of the Serialize method using generics rather than an object along with its Type. It does 
                        nothing besides calling back into the non generic version but is much more pleasant to use as a consumer of the API.
                        The pattern for the corresponding Deserialize method(s) is the same, in reversed order.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can probably imagine what the Type Provider interface looks like at this point, here's what I came up with:
                    </p>
                    <code>
<pre>
public interface IStoneTypeProvider
{
    bool CanProvideType(StoneEngineContext context, Type type);
    IStoneNode CreateNodeFromData(StoneEngineContext context, object data, Type type);
    IStoneNode CreateNodeFromSource(StoneEngineContext context, StoneTokenWalker tokenWalker, Type type);
    object CreateData(StoneEngineContext context, IStoneNode node, Type type);
    string CreateSource(StoneEngineContext context, IStoneNode node, Type type);
}    
</pre>
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        The Token Rule interface is even smaller:
                    </p>
                    <code>
<pre>
public interface IStoneTokenRule
{
    bool CanCreateToken(StoneSourceWalker sourceWalker);
    IStoneToken CreateToken(StoneSourceWalker sourceWalker);
}    
</pre>
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        What's happening inside that code is pretty straight forward, it builds a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(abstract_data_type)">tree</a>,
                        a common data structure in computer science that can be used within all kinds of different domains like the implementation of
                        programming languages or UI layout engines, just to name a few. For serialization, the tree is directly built from the data, 
                        the received object, no intermediate steps taken. For deserialization, there's a tokenization step happening that utilizes
                        the aforementioned Token Rule interface. By the way, the nodes stored inside the tree as well as the tokens produced by
                        token rules are interfaces as well, essentially just a qualifier to make any custom types compatible with the APIs,
                        they do not provide <i>any</i> contract at all. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the point in time when creating this project, I considered an interface-heavy approach to qualify as highly modular,
                        even today I still don't know what to think about this approach. Is it really modular if there's no logic provided at all?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This kind of implementation definitely ended up doing some harm, it's not straightforward to follow
                        the flow of execution and all the interfaces consumers feel bloated to me, although that's subjective.
                        With bloated, I'm talking in terms of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle">Single Responsibility Principe</a>.
                        There's a lot of different interpretations on what's that about, but my favorite conclusion is <b>a piece of logic should only do one thing, but do it well</b>,
                        while a piece of logic could actually anything between a method, a data type (aka an object) or even a module. In our case,
                        this piece of logic is the Type Provider interface, and simply by taking a look at the methods names it's obvious that it's
                        is doing more than that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One could say, it does handle serialization and deserialization and it has some kind of precondition.
                        Alternatively, it does work with objects and it does work with strings, in both of these views it 
                        would be reasonable to split this apart into freestanding serialization and deserialization providers 
                        that do not need to interfere with each other. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The class responsible for serialization and deserialization of simple integers consists of around 70 lines of code
                        and it didn't get any better for more complex types like dictionaries or multidimensional arrays. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For comparison, the file I consider to be the core ends up around 550 lines of code while containing all
                        the essential types and functionality. It holds the interface definitions, the tokenizer, the utility classes
                        used for iterating and consuming strings and tokens, the engine itself and all of the other good stuff. The actual
                        implementation (all the different kinds of Token Rules and Type Providers as well as a little bit of utility) is
                        around 2.300 lines of code, that's more than four times the amount of the underlying system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, about the design, I'll keep it short. It's easy because, naturally due to the modular implementation,
                        there is not necessary a single, fixed design for the object notation itself. Each Type Provider could theoretically
                        use its own distinct style of serialization and deserialization and still work seamlessly within the system, but for
                        my current implementation I settled on a simple 'TYPE = VALUE' pattern. Here's a small sample of a C# class definition
                        and the corresponding STONE representation:
                    </p>
                    <code>
<pre>
public class SomeClass<T>
{
    public T Value;
    public bool State;
    public SomeStruct<T, int, string> MemberStruct;
}

public struct SomeStruct<T1, T2, T3>
{
    public T1 A;
    public T1 B;
}
</pre>
                    </code>
                    <code>
<pre>
[Class] = {
    Value: [Float] = 0
    State: [Bool] = False
    MemberStruct: [Struct] = {
        A: [Float] = 0
        B: [Float] = 0
    }
}
</pre>
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        Performing a de/serialization operation is simple, a single method call on the engine:
                    </p>
                    <code>
<pre>
SomeClass&lt;float&gt; someClass = new SomeClass&lt;float&gt;();

string source = StoneEngine.Serialize(someClass);
someClass = StoneEngine.Deserialize&lt;SomeClass&lt;float&gt;&gt;(source);
</pre>
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        Of course we need to provide Token Rules and Type Providers if we want anything to happen at all,
                        as previously mentioned the engine itself would just throw an exception if we'd try to de/serialize 
                        something without any of those interfaces being registered (which practically is, again, a single method call).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Honestly, implementing those interfaces is kind of a chore, the involved APIs of the engine and Token/Source Walkers
                        are not too much fun to use. I'll attach the source code of the actual Type Provider for integers at the very end of this post,
                        to not scare you away immediately.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thankfully, we can just continue using the few Type Providers I already implemented when creating this project, they handle
                        a decent amount of types (for a hobby object notation that was written within a few days) but are not versatile enough
                        to turn STONE into a serious alternative for any other format. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, one of the biggest downsides (especially for the .NET ecosystem) 
                        is my deliberate design choice of only handling fields, no properties. This naturally excludes de/serialization of interfaces,
                        as those are not able to hold fields at all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What the currently implemented Type Providers <i>can</i> handle are different kinds of Arrays (both n-dimensional and jagged), generic lists and dictionaries,
                        enums, structs and most of the primitives one would expect (integers, strings and more). It also works for both base classes and child classes, but the latter 
                        is more of a side effect in the system and not something that's explicitly supported. Who knows when this will break,  I've never used
                        STONE for anything after creating it which also means I won't catch any of the hidden bugs and/or edge cases.

                    <p>
                        At the beginning, I said that each Type Provider could theoretically use its own distinct style of serialization and deserialization
                        and still work seamlessly within the system, I'll not talk about this <i>too</i> much as its barely an intuitive thing to do, but let
                        me show you a simple example for the usual Type Provider and an alternative 'gibberish' version for integers: 
                    </p>
                    <code>
<pre>
try
{
    string source = StoneEngine.Serialize(-420);
    int value = StoneEngine.Deserialize<int>(source);
    
    Logging.Log(source);

    StoneEngine.UnregisterTypeProvider(StoneBuiltinTypeProviders.TypeProvider_Int32);
    StoneEngine.RegisterTypeProvider(new DemoTypeProvider_GibberishInt());

    source = StoneEngine.Serialize(value);
    value = StoneEngine.Deserialize<int>(source);
    
    Logging.Log(source);

    Logging.Log(value);
}
catch (StoneException exception)
{
    Logging.LogException(exception);
}
</pre>
                    </code>
                    <code>
<pre>
[Int] = -420
&lt;/\&lt; | ZRRRRQQ
-420
</pre>

                    <p>
                        The try-catch block is kind of redundant, I do know there's a Type Provider registered for the first operation
                        and any proceeding operations are basically a roundtrip of the data, but in a real world scenario it's 
                        definitely a good idea to not blindly trust your de/serialization mechanism, not even or especially
                        not if you've written it yourself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nonetheless, as you can see, our final data within the program is the very same as the one we initially serialized,
                        and it even went through multiple different formats. Also, as I said, un/registering Type Providers
                        is as easy as a single method call (although in this specific example, it would be impossible to
                        ever unregister the gibberish Type Provider because we're not keeping a reference to it).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, here's the promised source code for the Type Provider of integers:
                    </p>

        if (Int32.TryParse(valueNode.TextValue, out Int32 result))
        {
            return result;
        }

        throw new StoneBuiltinsException("Error creating Int32");
    }

    public string CreateSource(StoneEngineContext context, IStoneNode node, Type type)
    {
        StoneValue valueNode = (StoneValue)node;
        StoneSourceFormattingContext sourceFormattingContext = context.SourceFormatting;

        return $"{sourceFormattingContext.Indentation()}[{valueNode.Annotation}] = {valueNode.TextValue}";
    }
}
