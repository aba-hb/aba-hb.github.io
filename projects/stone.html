[String] = "STONE"

                    <p>
                        It was towards the end of 2024 when I decided that I needed yet another side project,
                        a tiny one I could finish over the course of two or maybe three days. I was (and still am)
                        pretty interested in language development and creating a custom object notation as well as a
                        corresponding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization">de/serialization</a> engine 
                        sounded like a fun idea.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you're wondering about those funny words, de/serialization is the process of converting
                        data inside a program into a (usually) language-independent format like text (for example
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a>)
                        and vice versa. An object notation is simply that very same language-independent format, the specific structure the text needs
                        to take on (perhaps just another word for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)">syntax</a>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I always had this idea of an object notation with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking">static typing</a>,
                        still no clue how this is supposed to be useful for anything that proper object notations didn't solve already, but I just gave it a shot. 
                        Additionally, I also wanted to experiment with a modular approach to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis">tokenization</a>
                        and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing">parsing</a>, this project was naturally a good fit and acted as a 2-in-1 learning experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So I grabbed one of my favorite languages (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C#</a>), spent my mental capacities on finding a really
                        terrible name for my idea and ended up creating STONE. If it's not clear by the title of this post, the name is an abbreviation for <b>S</b>tatically <b>T</b>yped
                        <b>O</b>bject <b>N</b>otation <b>E</b>xperiment (I won't type that out another time, promised).

                    <h3>Implementation & Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        You might be thinking <i>Hey, shouldn't the order be Design & Implementation?</i> and that would be a fair assumption,
                        but due to one of the goals being a highly modular approach to tokenization and parsing and those functionalities kind of
                        being a precondition when trying to transform text into another format, I started with figuring out that part.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What I came up with are a few interfaces, primarily two ones called Token Rule and Type Provider. By contributing their own pieces of functionality and being able to
                        recursively call back into the engine, they handle most of the processing involved in serializing data and deserializing its STONE representation. 
                        Without any of those interfaces being registered in the appropriate locations, the engine is merely a fancy mechanism to throw exceptions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The engine itself, especially for serialization, does nothing besides delegating the work into Type Providers. 
                        For deserialization, there's additional work that utilizes the Token Rules to transform the text into a more structured representation before, 
                        again, delegating the work into Type Providers. The only real functionalities provided by the engine are what I called a Source Walker and a Token Walker,
                        fancy names for something that's essentially iterating over a collection, tracking the current position inside of it and potentially allowing to backtrack.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'll show you the few important methods used for serialization, it's pretty simple:
                    </p>
                    <code>
<pre>
public static string Serialize(object data, Type type)
{
    // ... some safety checks ...

    StoneTree tree = CreateTreeFromData(data, type);
    string source = CreateSourceFromTree(tree, type);

    return source;
}


private static StoneTree CreateTreeFromData(object data, Type type)
{
    StoneEngineContext context = new StoneEngineContext
    {
        SourceFormatting = new StoneSourceFormattingContext(),
        CustomContexts = new Dictionary<Type, IStoneCustomContext>(),
    };

    for (int i = 0; i < m_TypeProviders.Count; i++)
    {
        if (m_TypeProviders[i].CanProvideType(context, type))
        {
            IStoneTreeNode rootNode = m_TypeProviders[i].CreateNodeFromData(context, data, type);
            return new StoneTree { Root = rootNode };
        }
    }

    throw new StoneEngineException($"No TypeProvider for {type}");
}


private static string CreateSourceFromTree(StoneTree tree, Type type)
{
    StoneEngineContext context = new StoneEngineContext
    {
        SourceFormatting = new StoneSourceFormattingContext(),
        CustomContexts = new Dictionary<Type, IStoneCustomContext>(),
    };

    for (int i = 0; i < m_TypeProviders.Count; i++)
    {
        if (m_TypeProviders[i].CanProvideType(context, type))
        {
            return m_TypeProviders[i].CreateSource(context, tree.Root, type);
        }
    }

    throw new StoneEngineException($"No TypeProvider for {type}");
}
</pre>
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        There's another version of the Serialize method using generics rather than an object along with its Type. It does 
                        nothing besides calling back into the non generic version but is much more pleasant to use as a consumer of the API.
                        The pattern for the corresponding Deserialize method(s) is the same, in reversed order.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can probably imagine what the Type Provider interface looks like at this point but I'll share it anyways:
                    </p>
                    <code>
<pre>
public interface IStoneTypeProvider
{
    bool CanProvideType(StoneEngineContext context, Type type);
    IStoneNode CreateNodeFromData(StoneEngineContext context, object data, Type type);
    IStoneNode CreateNodeFromSource(StoneEngineContext context, StoneTokenWalker tokenWalker, Type type);
    object CreateData(StoneEngineContext context, IStoneNode node, Type type);
    string CreateSource(StoneEngineContext context, IStoneNode node, Type type);
}    
</pre>
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        Let's also take a look at the Token Rule interface, that one is a little more lightweight:
                    </p>
                    <code>
<pre>
public interface IStoneTokenRule
{
    bool CanCreateToken(StoneSourceWalker sourceWalker);
    IStoneToken CreateToken(StoneSourceWalker sourceWalker);
}    
</pre>
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        What's happening behind the curtains of all prior code is pretty straight forward, it builds a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(abstract_data_type)">tree</a>,
                        a common data structure in computer science that can be used within all kinds of different domains like the implementation of
                        programming languages or UI layout engines, just to name a few. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For serialization, the tree is directly built from the data, 
                        the received object, no intermediate steps taken. For deserialization, there's a tokenization step happening that utilizes
                        the aforementioned Token Rule interface. All nodes stored inside the tree and all tokens generated inside the tokenization step
                        are defined as empty interfaces, merely a 'tag' to make any user types compatible with the engines APIs but not enforcing a specific contract.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The tokenization step is performed by a Tokenizer class that injects a Source Walker into Token Rules which in return output
                        different kinds of tokens. Those thokens are what's actually used by the Type Providers, but facilitated inside a Token Walker.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here's an example of the full source code for one of the Token Rules I had to implement:
                    </p>
                    <code>
<pre>
public class StoneTokenRule_Constant : IStoneTokenRule
{
    public bool CanCreateToken(StoneSourceWalker sourceWalker)
    {
        if (char.IsLetterOrDigit(sourceWalker.Peek()))
        {
            return true;
        }

        return false;
    }

    public IStoneToken CreateToken(StoneSourceWalker sourceWalker)
    {
        sourceWalker.BeginSample();

        while (sourceWalker.IsFinished() == false
            && char.IsLetterOrDigit(sourceWalker.Peek()))
        {
            sourceWalker.Advance();
        }

        return new StoneBuiltinToken
        {
            Type = StoneBuiltinTokenType.Constant,
            SourceSample = sourceWalker.ExtractSample(),
        };
    }
}
</pre>
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        As for all of the interfaces, there's no rules on how to perform any operations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, this architecture ended up a little annoying to build on top of, a real pain point is that the order Type Providers are
                        being checked in does matter a lot because some types might qualify for different Type Providers, but somehow it worked out and ended 
                        up as a basic but functional and extendable solution for de/serialization needs. The project itself consists of nearly 3.000 lines of code,
                        around 600 resembling the core, everything else for the different Type Providers, Token Rules and little bit of utility I had to implement
                        to get some halfway decent functionality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, about the design, I'll keep it short. It's easy because, naturally due to the modular implementation,
                        there is not necessary a single fixed design for the object notation. Each Type Provider could theoretically
                        use its own distinct style of serialization and deserialization and still work seamlessly within the system and
                        even different kinds of Token Rules producing completely different objects can work as a whole. It's of course much
                        more intuitive to <i>not</i> do weird things like that, so I tried sticking to a <b>[TYPE] = VALUE</b> pattern for the currently
                        supported types. Let's take a look at a small sample of a C# class definition and the corresponding STONE representation:
                    </p>
                    <code>
<pre>
public class SomeClass<T>
{
    public T Value;
    public bool State;
    public SomeStruct<T, int, string> MemberStruct;
}

public struct SomeStruct<T1, T2, T3>
{
    public T1 A;
    public T1 B;
}


string source = StoneEngine.Serialize(new SomeClass&lt;float&gt;());
</pre>
                    </code>
                    <p>
                    </p>
                    <code>
<pre>
[Class] = {
    Value: [Float] = 0
    State: [Bool] = False
    MemberStruct: [Struct] = {
        A: [Float] = 0
        B: [Float] = 0
    }
}
</pre>
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        For comparison, an equivalent JSON output would look like this:
                    </p>
                    <code>
<pre>
{
  "Value": 0.0,
  "State": false,
  "MemberStruct": {
    "A": 0.0,
    "B": 0.0
  }
}
</pre>
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        They're looking pretty similar but there's also an obvious difference, as I previously mentioned 
                        this was supposed to be statically typed, or at least something with some amount of type information
                        and to accomplish that goal I ended up with that [TYPE]. Individual Type Providers can freely choose what 
                        kind of annotation they're using. At the deserialization step when trying to convert the text back into 
                        data, the annotation is used to decide on the Type Provider to use for the current operation. Whatever follows
                        after the annotation and the equal sign is dependent on the actual type being serialized, but all in all the 
                        output shouldn't look <i>too</i> surprising in any scenarios (maybe there's an exception to this).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of course those Type Providers and also the Token Rules need to come from <i>somewhere</i> if the engine should
                        be able to de/serialize anything, it would just throw an exception if we'd try to de/serialize something
                        without any of those interfaces being registered. Doing so is just a method call, but the current 
                        implementation does provide another method that registers (or unregisters) all of the existing 
                        Type Providers in the correct order at once.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Honestly, implementing those interfaces is kind of a chore, the involved APIs of the engine and Token/Source Walkers
                        are not too much fun to use due to the uncertainty of the types someone's working with. I'll attach the source code 
                        of the actual Type Provider for integers at the very end of this post, to not make you angry right now.

                        Thankfully, the Type Providers and Token Rules I already implemented when creating this project handle a decent amount of types 
                        (for a hobby object notation that was written within a few days), but STONE is definitely not versatile enough to be any serious alternative to other formats. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, one of the biggest downsides (especially for the .NET ecosystem) is my deliberate design choice of only handling fields, not properties.
                        This also naturally excludes de/serialization of interfaces, as those are not able to hold fields at all. There's also no support for polymorphic
                        de/serialization, it's not possible to treat a child class as the base class without loosing the child specific data. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What the currently implemented Type Providers <i>can</i> handle are different kinds of Arrays (both n-dimensional and jagged), generic lists and dictionaries,
                        enums, structs and most of the primitives one would expect (integers, strings and more). It also works for both base classes and child classes, but the latter 
                        is more of a side effect in the system and not something that has a dedicated implementation somewhere in the code. Who knows when this will break, I gotta
                        say I've never used STONE for anything after creating it, which also means I couldn't experience any of the hidden bugs and/or edge cases yet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe you're willing to give it a try, even if it's for the lols and facepalms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the beginning, I said that each Type Provider could theoretically use its own distinct style of serialization and deserialization
                        and still work seamlessly within the system, I'll not talk about this <i>too</i> much as its barely an intuitive thing to do, but let me
                        show you a simple example for the usual Type Provider and an alternative 'gibberish' version that uses symbols and letters to represent integers:
                    </p>
                    <code>
<pre>
try
{
    string source = StoneEngine.Serialize(-314);
    int value = StoneEngine.Deserialize<int>(source);
    
    Logging.Log(source);

    StoneEngine.UnregisterTypeProvider(StoneBuiltinTypeProviders.TypeProvider_Int32);
    StoneEngine.RegisterTypeProvider(new DemoTypeProvider_GibberishInt());

    source = StoneEngine.Serialize(value);
    value = StoneEngine.Deserialize<int>(source);
    
    Logging.Log(source);

    Logging.Log(value);
}
catch (StoneException exception)
{
    Logging.LogException(exception);
}
</pre>
                    </code>
                    <code>
<pre>
[Int] = -314
&lt;/\&lt; | ZRRRRQQ
-314
</pre>
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        The try-catch block is kind of redundant, but in a real world scenario it would be a good idea to not blindly trust
                        your de/serialization solution, not even or especially not if you've written it yourself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nonetheless, as you can see, our final data within the program is the very same as the one we initially fed into the engine,
                        and it even went through multiple different formats. Although one flaw in this specific example is that someone wouldn't be able to
                        ever unregister the gibberish Type Provider because there's no reference to it outside of the engine itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To close up this paragraph, here's a sweet <b>wtf</b> fact for everyone to enjoy, the current implementation of STONE is able to
                        serialize data that's boxed inside the object type correctly, but it needs to maintain some type information of that data to properly be able to deserialize
                        it afterwards. This is done by including the assemblies name and the underlying data types name in the output, and for no good reasons I
                        decided to encode it in base64, still don't know what my reasoning was at that point. Here's what that looks like:
